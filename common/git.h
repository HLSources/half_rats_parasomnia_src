// Shepard - Half-Rats: Parasomnia's source code was (is still) under the
// popular Version Control Software (VCS): git.
//
// This file was re-generated before each build by a Batch/Shell script that
// grabbed the latest commit's SHA-1 and filled this variable.
//
// This was used by us (developers and beta-testers) to identify which builds
// contained the bugs and allowed us to check if the binaries were up to date.
//
// If you are still using git, you can (re)make that Batch/Shell script if you
// desire, otherwise you can just leave this variable empty or remove this file
// and any usage of it.
